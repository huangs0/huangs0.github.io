Before that, I got my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from the University of Hong Kong with First Class Honours. 
I also obtain several extensive industrial experience in NVIDIA, miHoYo, etc.

My current research interest spans across GPU-Related Operating and Networking System, especially the intra-gpu-kernel level performance engineering.
Previously I was also interested in mobile computing, human-computer interaction, web development, computer vision, etc.`
