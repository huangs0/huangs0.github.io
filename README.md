# Songlin's Personal Page

Simple, Configurable, and Acamdemic-oriented. 

## Getting Started

First clone the repo and you can find the source code in `/src` folder.

Then you can start the development server by:

```bash
npm install
# development server
npx next dev
# build and upload, output in `/out`
npx next build
```

## How to Configure

Nearly everything is configurable in the `/src/app/config.ts`:

```ts

  rawEmail: "huangs0 [at] hku [dot] hk",
  blogUrl: "https://huangs0.github.io",
  resumeUrl: "/resume.pdf",
};

// the summary, Markdown Supported!
export const summaryInfo = `I am a MPhil student in [HKU AIoT Lab](https://aiot.hku.hk) ...`

// the news and awards, also in Markdown
export const newsInfo: string[] = [
